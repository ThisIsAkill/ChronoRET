; unmatched.asm — Names for routines that matched code calls but that
; are not matched yet.
;
; Each entry is a label-only `org` stub: it emits no bytes, it only gives
; the call site a name instead of an address. When a routine gets
; matched, delete its stub here; the real label in the bank file takes
; over and every call site keeps working unchanged.
;
; Keeping these out of the bank files is deliberate: game code holds
; only game code (see tools/lint_readability.py, rule PLUMB).
